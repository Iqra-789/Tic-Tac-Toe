## Introduction

This project is a console-based implementation of Tic Tac Toe, a classic game where two players take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid to achieve a winning combination of their symbols ('X' or 'O'). The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.

## Features

- Allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe in a console environment.
- Provides a visual representation of the game board with each move.
- Validates player moves to ensure they are within the valid range and not already taken.
- Determines the winner or declares a draw at the end of the game.

## Usage

To play the game, simply compile and run the `main.cpp` file. Follow the on-screen prompts to take turns marking cells with your symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Game Setup**: 
   - Players take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid.
   - Player 1 uses 'X', and Player 2 uses 'O'.

2. **Taking Turns**:
   - On your turn, enter a number corresponding to the cell where you want to place your symbol.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - Achieve a winning combination of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.

4. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination or all cells are filled without a winner.
